# Internal

Although the repository is named Internal, this repository would contain small tools and projects that would be helpful for almost anyone working on AWS. 
Some of the planned tools include:

1) A simple credentials parser. Most of you might know about the toe's (terrorist order e's) spying equipment capabilities. They can see what you see. When you create
a new IAM user for programmatic access, download the csv file and open the csv file, they can see the Access key ID and Secret access key. Instead, the tool
would parse the file and read the Access key ID and Secret access key.

2) DynamoDB access samples
3) Cloudwatch log reader
4) SNS samples
5) Cognito samples
6) Programatically getting information about EC2 instances

I might do some live coding / AWS management samples on ALight Technology And Service Limited's youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBuu5ksejp5uPIJmPuReSTA and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWg1fhujnIf6b621UZ_SGg
or I might check-in the code samples.

This repository would serve the purpose of more code samples in .Net and would accompany ALight Technology And Service Limited's technical blog at https://www.alightservices.com/technical-blog/.

Happy development! :)
